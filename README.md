# LiftIt

See it live here: https://liftit-fitnesstracker.herokuapp.com/

A fullstack app with user authentication to track your progress as a weightlifter. After a workout, log your stats and the data will save to your account, along with storing your one rep max for each lift so you can easily see your progression to becoming like Schwarzenegger.


I built this in the MERN stack: React on the frontend and Node.js, Express and MongoDB in the back.
