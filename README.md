# LiftIt

See it live here: https://liftit-fitnesstracker.herokuapp.com/

A fullstack app with user authentication and api to track your progress as a weightlifter. After a workout, log your stats and the data will save to your account, along with storing your one rep max for each lift.


I built this in the MERN stack: React on the frontend and Node.js, Express and MongoDB in the back.
